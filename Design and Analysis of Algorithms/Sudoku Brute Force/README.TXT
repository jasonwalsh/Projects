PROJECT TITLE: Brute Force Sudoku Solver 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:To demonstrate and implement 
VERSION or DATE: Fall 2015
AUTHORS:Sean Mulhall and Dyona Tate

  For our first project in DAA, we were tasked with building a program that could solve a sudoku board using a brute force method. The 
  brute force method involves trying ever possible combination until a solution can be found. It is an extremely inefficiant algorithm 
  but was a good introduction into some pratical programming.
