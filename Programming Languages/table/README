This project was part of our "Common Code" project in PL. 
We set up a table, filled with Diners
The object was to place the diners at the table based on their common food choices
Each dish was given a score, and depending on how it was ranked by the diner,
we would alter the score by  using a modifier. This would allow diners with the same dish preference to be seated closly together
